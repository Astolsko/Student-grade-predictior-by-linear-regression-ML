# Student-grade-predictior-by-linear-regression-ML

We have performed a set of regression and classification tasks on the dataset to predict the grades of students in secondary school subjects based on a number of academic and demographic factors.


The *__Student Grade Prediction__* project uses Machine learning algorithms to perform classification and regression tasks on student grades, other socio-economic factors and predict student performance in cumulative assessments. This can be used to perform a detailed analysis of student performance and based on the results of the analysis, appropriate steps can be taken to improve the odds around ensuring better perfomance of students in academics.

Using a dataset collected in a high school, by collecting school reports and questionnaires. The full list of attribute variables can be found on: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance (UCI Machine Learning Repository).







## About Algorithms
## *Linear Regression*
Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). Linear regression is performed upon the data. It is used to predict the cumulative grade of the students when the input features are provided along with the progress of the students.

## *Logistic Regression*
Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression).
Logistic regression is used to perform classification tasks upon the student dataset.

## *Decision Tree Regression*
Decision tree builds regression or classification models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes.
It is used to predict the cumulative grade of the students when the input features are provided along with the progress of the students. It is used to improvise upon the previous algorithms.
